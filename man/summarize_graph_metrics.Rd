\title{Summarize Topological Properties of a Graph}
\usage{
summarize_graph_metrics(graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An \code{igraph} object or a data frame with columns \code{from} and \code{to} representing an edge list.}
}
\value{
A tibble with one row and multiple columns, each representing a graph-level metric.
}
\description{
Computes a comprehensive set of global topological metrics for an input graph,
including basic structure, connectivity, spectral properties, and complexity.
Supports both \code{igraph} objects and data frames representing edge lists.
}
\details{
Metrics computed:
\itemize{
\item Number of nodes and edges
\item Directed TRUE/FALSE
\item Graph density
\item Diameter and average path length of the largest connected component
\item Clustering coefficient (transitivity)
\item Degree assortativity
\item Average degree and betweenness centrality
\item Number of connected components and size of the largest connected component
\item Number of single nodes
\item Algebraic connectivity (second-smallest Laplacian eigenvalue)
\item Degree entropy (Shannon entropy of the degree distribution)
\item Gini coefficient of node degrees
\item Modularity of the community structure (via Louvain algorithm)
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
g <- igraph::sample_gnp(200, 0.05, directed = F)
summarize_graph_metrics(g)
