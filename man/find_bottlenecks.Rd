}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An \code{igraph} object representing the network to analyze or a
data frame containing a symbolic edge list in the first two columns. Additional
columns are considered as edge attributes.}

\item{method}{Character. Method to define bottlenecks: \code{"zscore"} or \code{"quantile"}.}

\item{degree_threshold}{Numeric. Upper threshold for standardized degree (only used if \code{method = "zscore"}).}

\item{betweenness_threshold}{Numeric. Lower threshold for standardized betweenness (used in both methods).}

\item{degree_quantile}{Numeric between 0 and 1. Quantile threshold for degree (used if \code{method = "quantile"}).}

\item{betweenness_quantile}{Numeric between 0 and 1. Quantile threshold for betweenness (used if \code{method = "quantile"}).}

\item{log_transform}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, applies \code{log1p} transformation to degree and betweenness.}

\item{plot}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, generates a plot of degree vs. betweenness highlighting bottlenecks.}

\item{focus_color}{Character. Color to display in the focus area of the plot (bottlenecks region).}

\item{bottleneck_names}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, labels bottleneck nodes on the plot.}

\item{bottleneck_cex}{Numeric. Font size scaling for bottleneck labels on the plot.}

\item{gg_extra}{List. Additional user-defined layers for the returned ggplot.
eg. list(ylim(-2,2), theme_bw(), theme(legend.position = "none"))}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
\item{\code{method}}{A message describing the method and thresholds used.}
\item{\code{result}}{A \code{tibble} with node name, degree, betweenness, transformed metrics, and bottleneck status.}
\item{\code{graph}}{The original graph with a new vertex attribute \code{bottleneck} (logical).}
}
If \code{plot = TRUE}, a scatter plot of degree vs. betweenness is displayed, highlighting bottlenecks.
}
\description{
Identifies bottleneck nodes in an \code{igraph} network as those with low degree
and high betweenness centrality. The function supports both standardized (z-score)
and quantile-based thresholding. Optionally, it produces a 2D scatter plot with
bottlenecks highlighted.
